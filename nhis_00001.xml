  <labl>Sample Person Weight</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[SAMPWEIGHT is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed variable that represents, with a few exceptions, the random selection of a sample person in the household to complete a supplement survey.  (The exceptions to this generalization are the 1983 health insurance supplement and 1993 health insurance, access to care, and family resources supplements, which were asked of all persons in the second half of the year.)

For survey years 1997 forward, SAMPWEIGHT is based on the Final Annual Sample Adult and Sample Child Weights in the original NHIS public use files. This weight should be used with variables taken from the sample adult or sample child supplements for 1997 on (as indicated by the supplement title in the "Source" section toward the top of each variable description). 

SAMPWEIGHT also contains the sampling weights for a subset of the pre-1997 supplements, for which the definition of a sample person, and the rules governing the selection of sample persons, are less consistent. The universe statements for SAMPWEIGHT document who was included in the supplements requiring use of this weight on a year-by-year basis. SAMPWEIGHT consistently represents the inverse probability of selection into a supplement, adjusted for non-response with additional post-stratification adjustments for age, race/ethnicity, and sex using the Census Bureau's population control totals.

Users should review the documentation for extracted variables--most notably the "Weights" section toward the top of each variable description--to ascertain which weight is the appropriate choice for a given survey year. See the User Notes on the use of sampling weights for additional information.]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesSAMPWEIGHT is a 12-digit numeric variable with three implied decimals. That is, values of 012345678912 should be interpreted as 12345678.912. The command files delivered with IPUMS extracts automatically divide SAMPWEIGHT by 1,000, so no further adjustment is needed.]]></codInstr>

  <labl>Sample adult flag</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[ASTATFLG identifies the record of a sample adult. A sample adult is the one person over age 18 per household who is randomly selected to complete the sample adult questionnaire. For 1997-2018, a sample adult is the one adult per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument to answer additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997.  All persons other than sample adults (those not having the value 1 in ASTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from the additional questions asked only of sample adults.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)  Every adult in each family, except for active duty armed forces members, was eligible to be selected as the sample adult.  

Prior to 2019, ASTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample adult" (code 4) for all adults in the family in the following two cases: 1) sample adult status was incorrectly assigned to someone in the armed forces, or 2) it could not be ascertained which adult in the family was chosen as sample adult.   

For 2020 only, SALNGPRTFLG further distinguishes between sample adults included in the longitudinal sample and sample adults included in the partial sample. Please see the user note on COVID-related changes to the NHIS for more information on the longitudinal and partial samples.

A similar flag variable, CSTATFLG, identifies the record of a sample child.

For 1997-2018, the sample child is the one person under age 18 per family who was selected at random by the computerized survey instrument for additional health-related questions, under the survey design instituted in 1997. All persons other than sample children (those not having the value 1 in CSTATFLG) are coded as "not in universe" for variables derived from these additional questions asked only of sample children.  (Some additional questions were asked of both sample adults and sample children.)   

Prior to 2019, Every child in each family, except for active duty armed forces members and emancipated minors, was eligible to be selected as the sample child.  Emancipated minors are persons age 14 to 17 who are married or living with a partner OR who live on their own without the supervision of a parent, other adult family member, or legal guardian.  

CSTATFLG has the value "no one selected as sample child" (code 4) for all children in the family in the following two cases prior to 2019: 1) if sample child status was incorrectly assigned to someone who was ineligible, or 2) if it was unknown which child in the family was chosen as sample child.

  <labl>Sexual orientation</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults ages 18 and older, SEXORIEN reports the person's sexual orientation. Respondents were asked "Which of the following best represents how you think of yourself?" Response options included: "gay" or "lesbian", "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay", "bisexual", "something else", and "I don't know the answer". The wording of the question differed slightly for men and women, with men being asked if they are "gay" or "straight, that is, not gay" and women being asked if they are "lesbian or gay" or "straight, that is, not lesbian or gay". Persons who responded "something else" or "I don't know the answer" were asked follow-up questions about what they meant by "something else" or "don't know," but due to sample size constraints, those responses are not included in the publicly-available data.

According to the 2020 Survey Description, for some variables, including SEXORIEN, the 2020 responses of sample adults that were part of the 2020 longitudinal sample were overwritten with their 2019 responses "to mitigate disclosure risks associated with differences in response from repeated measures among the same Sample Adults" (33). The sample adults' actual 2020 responses can be accessed through a Research Data Center (RDC). For more information on the 2020 longitudinal sample, please see SALNGPRTFLG.

SEXORIEN was first introduced in 2013. Users interested in learning more about the cognitive testing involved in developing the NHIS sexual orientation questions can refer to the NHIS question evaluation report.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For sample children and sample adults (or, prior to 2019, all persons) born outside the United States, YRSINUSG indicates how long they have been living in the United States.  In most cases, this information was collected via the question, "In what year did you come to the United States to stay?"  If the response to this question was "refused" or "don't know," the interviewer tried to collect the information via an alternatively phrased question: "About how long have you been in the United States?"   

The data included in the public use files for YRSINUSG are recodes of the responses to these questions, with each answer in the form of a calendar year converted to a number of years present.  The calendar year format of the initial question would have increased the precision of responses by discouraging rounding; the recoded format (number of years present) is easier for researchers to analyze.

Take note: Changes in the definition of U.S. born
In 1997-2001, the available codes distinguished between born in a U.S. state or D.C. or born outside of the U.S., where "outside of the U.S." included being born in a U.S. territory. In 2002, an additional category, "born in a U.S. territory" was introduced as distinct from born outside of the U.S. In 2019, the available codes changed so that born in the 50 states or D.C. was combined into a single category with born in a U.S. territory, distinguished from born outside of the U.S. or U.S. territory. 

According to the 2020 Survey Description, for some variables, including USBORN, the 2020 responses of sample adults that were part of the 2020 longitudinal sample were overwritten with their 2019 responses "to mitigate disclosure risks associated with differences in response from repeated measures among the same Sample Adults" (33).

  <labl>Educational attainment</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults (and, prior to 2019, for all persons aged 5 and older), EDUC reports the highest level of schooling an individual had completed, in terms of completed grades for persons with less than a high school degree, and in terms of degrees attained for high school graduates and those with higher education.  Respondents were handed a card listing recognized categories and asked to identify the correct category.

According to the Field Representative's Manuals for 1997-2000, only "regular schooling which advances a person toward an elementary or high school diploma, or a college/university/professional school (such as law, medicine, dentistry)" counted as education.  Schooling in settings other than "regular schools" counted only if the credits obtained were acceptable in a regular school system.  Thus, for example, "adult education" classes not taken for credit or for the attainment of a college degree did not count.  

For the end of high school, EDUC distinguishes between those who completed twelfth grade but did not attain a diploma (e.g., those who failed to pass state-mandated high school exit examinations), those who graduated from high school, and those passed the GED (General Equivalence Degree) Test (which certifies that the test taker has attained high school-level academic skills).  Persons who attained a high school diploma in less than twelve years were to be recorded as "high school graduates," a guideline consistent with EDUC's emphasis on degrees attained rather than years spent in the classroom.  The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to probe to determine whether persons who attended "post-graduate" high school classes but did not attend college had received a high school diploma.  

For nurses, interviewers were to determine whether training was received in a college or in a nursing school (with the grade completed at the last regular--non-nursing--school to be entered in the latter case).  For a person attending special education classes or a school for persons with mental, physical, or developmental difficulties, interviewers were to ask which grade in a regular school most closely matched the individual's education level.  Persons currently in school were generally assumed to have completed the previous grade.]]></txt>

  <labl>Employment status in past 1 to 2 weeks</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT reports whether sample adults were working last week--working for pay; temporarily absent due to illness, vacation, family or maternity leave, or another reason; performing seasonal or contract work; or working at a job or business but NOT for pay (WHYNOWK2). Responses of "no" include both sample adults who were part of the labor force but unemployed and sample adults who were out of the labor force. Additional detail about reasons for not working in the past week can be found in WHYNOWK2. Before 2019, EMPSTAT reports whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or were looking for work or on layoff during the preceding two weeks (for 1969-1996) or during the preceding week (for 1997-2018).

In 1969-1996, EMPSTAT is a summary recode of responses to a series of questions. 
&nbsp;In 1969-1973 interviewers first asked, "Did [person] work at any time last week or the week before - (For females): not counting work around the house?" This question was also asked in 1974-1981, but the wording in these years omitted the instructions "For females" before the phrase "not counting work around the house." In 1982-1996 the question wording was changed to, "During those 2 weeks, did [person] work at any time at a job or business, not counting work around the house? (Include unpaid work in the family farm/business.)

If the answer to the initial question asked in 1969-1996 was negative, interviewers asked whether the person had a job or business, even though he/she did not work during the reference period. The final questions used to categorize current employment status in 1969-1996 were, "Was he looking for work or on layoff from a job [during those 2 weeks]?" and, if yes, "Which--looking for work or on layoff from a job?"In 1997-2018, respondents were asked one general question to ascertain their employment status. 
&nbsp;Interviewers asked, "Which of the following was [person] doing last week?"  In 1997-2000 interviewers read the following possible responses: "Working at a job or business," "With a job or business but not at work," "Looking for work," and "Not working at a job or business."  Beginning in 2001, the response category "Working at a job or business" was split into two separate categories, "Working for pay at a job or business" and "Working, but not for pay, at a job or business."  The rest of the response categories in 2001-2018 are the same as in 1997-2000.In 2019 forward, EMPSTAT indicates whether someone was employed or not employed in the last week.
&nbsp;Respondents are asked a series of questions that are used to code a final response to EMPSTAT:

"LAST WEEK, did you work for pay at a job or business?"

"Did you have a job or business LAST WEEK, but were temporarily absent due to illness, vacation, family or maternity leave, or some other reason?"

"What is the MAIN reason you were not working for pay at a job or business last week?"

"Does [sample adult] work for pay at a job or business?"
NCHS uses these responses to code an individual as "Employed" or "Not employed" in EMPSTAT. Those who indicate they were performing seasonal or contract work or were working at a job or business but not for pay are coded as "Employed." In 2021, only seasonal or contract workers who also worked in the past 12 months are coded as "Employed."Definitions and Instructions]]></txt>

  <labl>Total hours worked last week or usually</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 18+ (and all persons age 18+ in 2004-2018) who worked at a paid or unpaid job or business last week, held a seasonal or contract position last week, or were not working last week because they were on vacation, on family/maternity leave, unable to work for health reasons, HOURSWRK reports the total hours that the sample person worked in the past week. or in the past two weeks at all jobs/ businesses or at the main job/business. The universe and time period for HOURSWRK were somewhat different for 1979 and 1991. HOURSWORK reports total hours worked in the past two weeks for sample persons aged 17+ in 1979 who, during the past 2 weeks, worked, had a job or business from which they were temporarily absent, or looked for work or were on layoff; in 1991, HOURSWORK reports total work hours worked in the  past two weeks for sample persons aged 18+ in 1991 who were employed in the past 2 weeks and worked for a private company or the federal, state, or local government. Please refer to the Universe and Comparability tabs for more information about changes in the universe, time period, and the types of jobs included in HOURSWRK.

Beginning in 2019, sample adults aged 18+ who held a seasonal or contract position last week continued to be identified by NCHS as included in the universe for HOURSWORK, but were omitted from the HOURSWRK question and had their responses set to "Unknown - Not Ascertained."]]></txt>

This variable was first introduced in 1984 as part of the Supplement on Aging. From 1993 to 1996, this variable is part of the Family Resources supplement that provides information on individuals' health benefits, amount of coverage and income received from employment, welfare benefits, public assistance, and savings.

Questions in the Family Resources supplement are different from those in the core survey in terms of the content and the treatment of missing data. Questions in the Family Resources were normally asked of the month prior to the interview while the core survey asked of the last calendar year. All missing data in the Family Resources supplement were imputed by NHIS. Users can refer to the imputation flag variables OWNFL, RENTMONEYFL, and RENTFREEFL to identify persons with imputed data.]]></txt>

  <labl>Height in inches without shoes</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[HEIGHT reports the approximate height of sample adults and sample children ages 10-17, in inches. Prior to 2020, HEIGHT was only asked of adults. The values for this variable are based on self-reports or proxy reports/estimates by respondents for other household members, supplied in response to the question, "About how tall is [person] without shoes?"  Such data are less accurate than, and thus not fully comparable to, data on height gleaned via direct measurement in other surveys, such as NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics). In 1974 only, the question does not specify "without shoes."

According to the 2020 Survey Description, for some variables, including HEIGHT, the 2020 responses of sample adults that were part of the 2020 longitudinal sample were overwritten with their 2019 responses "to mitigate disclosure risks associated with differences in response from repeated measures among the same Sample Adults" (33). The sample adults' actual 2020 responses can be accessed through a Research Data Center (RDC). For more information on the 2020 longitudinal sample, please see SALNGPRTFLG.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[WEIGHT reports the approximate weight of sample adults and sample children ages 10-17, in pounds. Prior to 2020, WEIGHT is only asked of adults. The values for this variable are based on self-reports or proxy reports/estimates by respondents for other household members, supplied in response to the question, "About how much does [person] weigh without shoes?" In 1974 only, the question does not specify "without shoes" and in 1976 and 1977 the question specifies "without clothes or shoes."  

Such verbally reported data are less accurate than, and thus not fully comparable to, data on weight gleaned via direct measurement in other surveys, such as NHANES (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey fielded by the National Center for Health Statistics).  Indeed, the Field Representative's Manual for 1991 specified that one rationale for collecting height and weight data in the NHIS was to compare respondents' answers to the distribution of actual body measurements obtained in the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, "to determine the reliability of self-reported or proxy-reported heights and weights."]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesWEIGHT is a 3-digit-numeric variable. The upper and lower weight thresholds for public data suppression vary over time.  User should carefully review the codes below before making cross-year comparisons or interpreting results.

  <labl>Body Mass Index, calculated from publicly released height and weight variables</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[BMICALC reports the Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight, as calculated by IPUMS NHIS from the public use file data on height and weight.  BMICALC was calculated using the following formula: [Weight in pounds/(Height in inches, squared)] multiplied by 703 and rounded to one digit past the implied decimal point.  Individuals not asked their weight and height are coded "000" (for "Not in universe") for BMICALC.   Individuals whose weight or height was topcoded, bottomcoded, or, for 1997 forward, an outlying value that was suppressed for confidentiality reasons, receive a code of "996" for BMICALC.

The website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on BMI reports the following "standard weight status categories associated with BMI ranges for adults."  BMI below 18.5 is associated with "underweight" weight status; BMI 18.5 to 24.9 is associated with "normal" weight status; BMI 25.0 to 29.9 is associated with "overweight" weight status; BMI 30.0 and above is associated with "obese" weight status.  
&nbsp;The CDC website also notes, "the correlation between the BMI number and body fatness is fairly strong; however, the correlation varies by sex, race, and age."  For example, women tend to have more body fat than men at the same BMI; older people, on average, tend to have more body fat than young adults; and highly trained athletes may have a high BMI because of increased muscularity rather than increased body fatness.  The CDC adds, "It is important to remember that BMI is only one factor related to risk for disease," and that other predictors, such as waist circumference and levels of blood pressure and physical activity, are also important.]]></txt>
  <codInstr><![CDATA[CodesBMICALC is a 4-digit numeric variable with one implied decimal place. That is, a value of 0123 should be interpreted as 12.3 The command files delivered with IPUMS extracts automatically divide BMICALC by 10, so no further adjustment is needed.

Prior to 2020, BMICAT is only asked of adults. For 1991, 1993, 1995, and 1997-2018, IPUMS NHIS staff recoded the values of BMI to create BMICAT. Beginning in 2019, BMI was no longer made available by NCHS on the original NHIS files and BMICAT replaced BMI.

  <labl>Medical care delayed due to cost, past 12 months</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults and sample children, DELAYCOST indicates whether, during the past twelve months, individuals delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost. In 1993, DELAYCOST was asked of all persons in quarters 3 and 4 and in 1994-2018 it was asked of all persons. For 1997-2018, respondents were explicitly told not to include dental care when answering this question. Beginning in 2019, respondents were not told to exclude dental care when answering this question, but they were also asked whether, during the past 12 months, they had delayed getting dental care due to the cost (DELAYDT). 

 The Field Representative's Manual for 1993 forward noted, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."  This definition of the term was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables&nbsp;Several other variables available for 1997 forward address reasons other than "worry about the cost" that caused sample adults and sample children to delay getting medical care.  The non-financial reasons for delays in getting medical care identified in these variables are: "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

Available for 1997 forward, YBARCARE, which identifies individuals who needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it during the past 12 months, covers some of the same ground as DELAYCOST.  However, the wording of the question for YBARCARE implies that medical care was foregone for financial reasons, while the wording of the question for DELAYCOST refers to care delayed for financial reasons.  The difference in these two variables may, however, be less than is implied by this semantic distinction.  In the case of some acute illnesses (such as respiratory infections and "stomach flu"), medical care that was delayed was doubtless ultimately foregone in many cases.]]></txt>

For sample adults, MHRX refers to prescription medications taken to help with emotions, concentration, behavior, or mental health other than worry or depression. For sample children, MHRX refers to prescription medications to help with emotions, concentration, behavior, or mental health including worry or depression.

MHRX is one of a set of variables covering mental health care. Other mental health care variables include:

  <labl>Ever told had a learning disability</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[LEARNDEV reports whether the person has a learning disability. Please see Comparability and Universe tabs for changes in universe and question wording between samples.
&nbsp;In 1994 and 1995, this variable is part of the Disability Supplement (NHIS-D) that collects information on disability. NHIS-D included two household interviews: in Phase I all members of sample families were screened for any indication of disability; in Phase II persons with any indication of disability were followed-up for additional information. Phase I includes sensory, communication, and mobility problems; health conditions; activities of daily living and independent activities of daily living; functional limitations; mental health; services and benefits; special health needs of children; early child development; education; relationship to respondent; and perceived disability. Phase II includes four Disability Followback Survey (DFS) questionnaires: one for children, one for adults, one for elderly persons (69 years of age and over) without any indication of disability (also called the Supplement on Aging or SOA; only in 1994), and one for persons with a history of polio.

Children "who have difficulty learning as a result of visual, hearing, motor, mental retardation, or emotional disturbance" may have also received a positive response for one of the following four variables: ADDEV (Ever told had attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder); RETEV (Ever told have intellectual disability); or ODDEV (Ever told have other developmental delay); and AUTISMEV (Ever told have autism).]]></txt>

  <labl>Ever told had a stroke</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[STROKEV identifies adults whom a doctor or other health professional ever diagnosed as having had a stroke.  In 2002 and 2007, persons who had ever been diagnosed with a stroke were asked whether they had a stroke during the past 12 months (STROKEYR). Please see Comparability and Universe tabs for complete information on universe changes between samples.

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 directed interviewers to "include strokes, cerebrovascular accidents, and brain hemorrhages," but this directive was not stated during the interview.  Stroke was defined in the Field Representative's Manual for 2001 forward as "a cerebral hemorrhage or embolism of the cerebral blood vessels," but this definition was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables&nbsp;Information on whether persons age 20 and older ever had a stroke is also available in 1977 (STROKEWOC).  The information included in STROKEWOC was collected via two separate lines of questioning.  Interviewers asked, "Has [name] ever had a stroke?" and "Has a doctor ever told [name] he had a stroke?"  In addition, the person was recorded as having had a stroke and asked about a doctor's diagnosis of the condition if "stroke" was reported as the reason why an individual was limited in daily activities (i.e., "needs the help of another person in getting around," "stays in bed all or most of the day," "needs help in bathing/dressing/eating/using the toilet"). 

Only cases coded as "2" (Yes, medically confirmed) in STROKEWOC are roughly comparable to cases with an affirmative response in STROKEV.   Along with the notable difference in question wording for the two variables, there is a difference in the range of responses that were accepted.  In the 1977 inquiry, interviewers were directed to reask the question if a term other than "stroke" (such as "brain hemorrhage") was reported, and to consider as a "No" response any term other than "stroke."  By contrast, as noted above, for STROKEV, other terms such as "cerebral hemorrhage" and "cerebrovascular accident" were accepted as "Yes" responses.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults, HRSLEEP reports how many hours, on average, the respondent sleeps per day. For surveys prior to 2004, interviewers were instructed to write down responses verbatim.  From 2004 forward, interviewers were instructed to report the hours of sleep in whole numbers, rounding values of 30 minutes or more UP to the nearest hour or otherwise rounding down. IPUMS NHIS recodes the values from the earlier surveys into whole number values, following the same rules as 2004 forward.

Beginning in 2020, HRSLEEP is one of a set of rotating core variables on sleep duration and quality collected by the NHIS every other year. In addition to HRSLEEP, other variables in the sleep rotating core include:

Sample Adults
SLEEPRESTFRQ: How often woke up feeling well rested, past 30 days

SLEEPFALLFRQ: How often had trouble falling asleep, past 30 days

SLEEPSTAYFRQ: How often had trouble staying asleep, past 30 days

SLEEPMEDFRQ: How often took medication for sleep, past 30 days
Sample Children
CSLEEPREST: How often wake up feeling well rested in a typical school week

CSLEEPGETUP: How often difficult to get out of bed in the morning in a typical school week

CSLEEPTIRED: How often complain of being tired during the day in a typical school week

CSLEEPNAPS: How often nap or fall asleep during the day in a typical school week

CSLEEPBEDTIME: How often have a regular bedtime on school nights in a typical school week

CSLEEPWKTIME: How often wake up at same time in a typical school week
Related Variables on Sleep&nbsp;A set of questions on sleep were asked annually of sample adults in 2004-2018 that are similar to those asked beginning in 2020 but differ in the reference period (past week vs. past 30 days) and the structure of the response categories (number of days in past week vs. how often in the past 30 days). These variables include:

SLEEPREST: Days woke up feeling rested, past week

SLEEPFALL: Number of times having trouble falling asleep, past week

SLEEPSTAY: Number of times having trouble staying asleep, past week

SLEEPMEDS: Number of times taking medication for sleep, past week

  <labl>Feel anxious or nervous: past two weeks</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults, GADANX reports responses to the question, "Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge?"

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Scale&nbsp;GADANX is part of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale which can be used to screen and assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder. The GAD also has moderate sensitivity when screening for panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Additional GAD questions that are included as part of the NHIS are:

Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by...

not being able to stop or control worrying? (GADWORCTRL)

worrying too much about different things? (GADWORMUCH)

trouble relaxing? (GADRELAX)

being so restless that it's hard to sit still? (GADRSTLS)

becoming easily annoyed or irritable? (GADANNOY)

feeling afraid as if something awful might happen? (GADFEAR)
The NHIS offers a categorical summary measure, GADCAT, that is based on the summed responses to the above GAD variables. Users can also sum these variables themselves to create a total score that can be used for analysis and assessing severity of symptoms. For more information on how to calculate the total score for the GAD, please see GADCAT.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[Respondents reported whether their level of depression, the last time they felt depressed, was "a little," "a lot," or "somewhere in between a little and a lot." This question was only asked of respondents who reported feeling depressed (DEPFREQ) or who acknowledged taking medication for depression (DEPRX).

In 2010, this item was collected for sample adults who completed the Quality of Life supplement (administered to approximately a quarter of sample adults). In 2011-2017, this item was collected for sample adults who completed the Adult Functioning and Disability supplement (administered to a subset of sample adults). Beginning in 2018, this item was included on the sample adult questionnaire.]]></txt>
